Hello there! I am Mia Zhao, currently a freelance developer. I’ve worn a few different hats, from getting hands-on with Java and frontend development to technical program management. I am passionate about enhancing productivity and bringing exciting projects to life. Discovering [indie hackers](https://www.indiehackers.com/) and [product hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/) last year really lit a fire under me to start building things on my own.

_My career path has had its share of adventures, including an unplanned extended stay in China due to the pandemic, after I initially left my job in Canada for a gap year in Australia. Now, I'm in the US, embracing another career break, during which I honed my program management skills, achieved PMP certification, learned to pronounce the rolling "r". I'm also working on building personal projects._

As for why I’ve shifted roles over the years? I’m all about challenging myself and expanding my horizons.

I have lived in 7 cities in 3 countries and I am currently based in Seattle, WA. If you're curious about living in different parts of the world or just wanna talk tech, my contact info's right [here](/contact).
