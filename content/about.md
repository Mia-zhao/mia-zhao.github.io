Hello there! I am Mia Zhao, currently a freelance developer. I’ve worn a few different hats, from getting hands-on with Java and frontend development to technical program management. I am passionate about enhancing productivity and bringing exciting projects to life. Discovering [indie hackers](https://www.indiehackers.com/) and [product hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/) last year really lit a fire under me to start building things on my own.

_My career path has had its share of adventures, including an unplanned extended stay in China due to the pandemic, after I initially left my job in Canada for a gap year in Australia. Now, I'm in the US, embracing another career break, during which I honed my program management skills, achieved PMP certification, learned to pronounce the rolling "r". I'm also working on building personal projects._

As for why I’ve shifted roles over the years? I’m all about challenging myself and expanding my horizons.

My life values:

1. Live in the moment, expand experiences, and strive for excellence
2. Be aware of, observe, understand, and accept my emotions
3. Use my mind scientifically and care for my body
4. Keep curiosity alive and be a lifelong learner
5. Keep taking notes and develop a personal knowledge system (a second brain)
6. Have the courage to start fresh and learn from others
7. Show empathy and respect others
8. Be altruistic and do valuable things
9. Elevate my energy and embrace the "yes, and..." approach
